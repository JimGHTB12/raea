//! What an agent writes for raea, as Rust types: a project's brief, a script (storyboard or screenplay), a person's
//! taste and an object's plan. The agent writes them as TypeScript modules (docs/handoff/authoring.md); `raea run`
//! evaluates one, and its default export arrives here as JSON. The TypeScript declarations are generated from these
//! types (`declarations`), so what tsc checks is exactly what this crate reads.
