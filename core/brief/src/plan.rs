//! An object's plan, written before any geometry and frozen when building starts (docs/handoff/solids.md, "The plan
//! is the contract"). Generic over what's made: a crown, a feather and a rocking horse are all a concept and a tree of
//! named parts, each with a level, a count, and a material and style it has or inherits.
