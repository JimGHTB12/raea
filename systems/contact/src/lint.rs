//! `raea scene lint|explain EDIT.tsx`: where each part of a 3D scene meets the others, measured from their real
//! geometry on one frame. A part sits on what's under it (rays straight down from its lowest points find the surface
//! and the gap, to the tenth of a millimetre), hangs from or is mounted on what touches its top or sides, or is in the
//! air. A part a few millimetres above its surface floats, one whose foot is below the surface it stands on is sunk,
//! and two parts passing deep into each other clip (the clipping check's own test, wherever it is and not only where
//! the camera sees it). `lint` says the faults and fails on them; `explain` says what every part rests on.
//!
//! Every mesh and glTF model is a part (a model whole, its nodes named in what it's said to rest on); see-through,
//! unlit, `allowOverlap` and animating parts are left out, as the clipping check leaves them. The ground is the part
//! that has nothing under it and is big (a floor, a terrain): it rests on nothing and that's no fault.
