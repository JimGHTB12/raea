//! raea-page-host: one raea page in a headless Bevy app, driven and read the way the benches drive an app:
//! input injected as the messages winit writes (src/inject.rs), the page's document read as a
//! tree of its data-testid elements (src/page.rs, src/tree.rs), the window read back as a PNG, all over the Bevy Remote
//! Protocol (src/brp.rs: page.*) and an MCP bridge to it (src/mcp.rs). The bin (src/main.rs) mounts a bundle; an app
//! adds [`HostPlugin`] and mounts its own (page::mount), its systems around the host's.
