//! Bevy plugins in raea's engine (sdk/raea/docs/bevy-plugins.md). A project declares its plugins in package.json
//! (raea.plugins, or raea.bevy.plugins, its first name); tools/bevy-plugins.sh resolves the declarations into this crate's dependencies and features and
//! into src/declared.rs, which registers each plugin with raea-render's hooks (runtime/plugins/src/lib.rs). Every Engine
//! made afterwards adds the plugins, steps them by the frame index, and applies TSX's component rows through the
//! TypeRegistry; `bridge` gives TypeScript a plain headless App with any of them, and bevy_remote's method table to call
//! into it. What a plugin needed by hand (its adapter or its calls) is a module here, named by its declaration.
