# The plugin catalog's and the native host's third-party crates' licences (docs/release.feature RL2). The catalog (engine/bevy-plugins, every
# declared plugin on) pulls in crates a plain raea build doesn't; each of those ships in the public tree with its own
# licence files, copied from its source into LICENSES/<crate>-<version>/, and is listed in NOTICE between the markers
# below, with its version and licence expression. A crate that ships no licence file gets LICENSE.txt naming the
# expression its Cargo.toml declares. raea's own crates and vendor/ (each folder keeps its licence) aren't listed.

# Nothing is built: cargo metadata resolves the workspace twice (every catalog feature, then none) from Cargo.lock.
